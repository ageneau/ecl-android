Install procedure:
 
$ make 

This will download ECL into the ecl/ directory.

You might want to check the file 

   ecl/scripts.conf

before installing. There you can configure the GMP library and ECL
installation directories.

Depending on where you plan to install ECL, you might need to use
`sudo' for configuring, compiling and installing.

$ PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)

$ cd $(PROJECT_ROOT)/ecl

# Compile a 32-bits host ECL to do the cross compilation. If you're
running x86_64 linux, you'll need a multilib enabled GCC (aptitude
install gcc-multilib on debian/ubuntu)

$ cd $PROJECT_ROOT/ecl
$ ./configure_gmp_cross host
$ (cd $PROJECT_ROOT/ecl/build/host/gmp && make && make install)

Important note: on MacOS the bundled gmp library doesn't compile with
-m32 so you need to use the compatible MPIR library instead, I use this
version: http://www.mpir.org/mpir-2.5.1.tar.bz2. Use the
configure_gmp_cross to compile it ( do export
MPIR_SRC_DIR=/path/to/mpir-2.5.1 before running it )

$ ./configure_cross host
$ (cd $PROJECT_ROOT/ecl/build/host/ecl && make && make install)

If you only want to build for one type of system, feel free to skip
the steps for the other.

__Android__

# Set some environment variable to point to our installed SDKs
$ export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/opt/android/android-sdk # Adjust for your environment
$ export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=/opt/android/android-ndk # Adjust for your environment

# cross-compile the GMP library for Android
$ ./configure_gmp_cross android
$ (cd $PROJECT_ROOT/ecl/build/android/gmp && make && make install)

# cross-compile ECL for android
$ ./configure_cross android
$ (cd $PROJECT_ROOT/ecl/build/android/ecl && make && make install)

At this point you should have a working ECL executable in
/opt/ecl/android/bin/ecl. You can "adb push" it to the android
emulator and just execute it.

__iPhone__

# cross-compile the GMP library for the iPhone
$ ./configure_gmp_cross iPhoneOS
$ (cd $PROJECT_ROOT/ecl/build/iPhoneOS/gmp && make && make install)

# cross-compile ECL for the iPhone
$ ./configure_cross iPhoneOS
$ (cd $PROJECT_ROOT/ecl/build/iPhoneOS/ecl && make && make install)

# cross-compile the GMP library for the iPhone simulator
$ ./configure_gmp_cross iPhoneSimulator
$ (cd $PROJECT_ROOT/ecl/build/iPhoneSimulator/gmp && make && make install)

# cross-compile ECL for the iPhone simulator
$ ./configure_cross iPhoneSimulator
$ (cd $PROJECT_ROOT/ecl/build/iPhoneSimulator/ecl && make && make install)

# In order to make it easy to configure the Xcode projects, let's make
FAT binaries of the static libraries.
$ ./iPhone_universal

__Android projects__

You may want to edit the path to your ECL installation in this file

   android/hello-jni/jni/Android.mk

To run ecl using JNI from an android app, use the hello-jni project.
You can compile it using:
1. ndk-build
2. ant install
