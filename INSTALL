Install procedure:

$ make update # This download and patches the externals needed by the project

__Android__

# Set some environment variable to point to our installed SDKs
$ export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/opt/android/android-sdk # Adjust for your environment
$ export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=/opt/android/android-ndk # Adjust for your environment

$ make android

At this point you should have a working ECL executable in
./local-install/android/bin/ecl. You can "adb push" it to the android
emulator and just execute it.

__iPhone__

$ make ios

The compiled libraries should be in ./local-install/iPhoneUniversal

__Android projects__

To run ecl using JNI from an android app see the HelloEcl project (android/HelloEcl)
You might need to adapt the project to your environment first: 
$ android update project -t android-10 -p .

To compile it:
$ ndk-build
$ ant debug install


__Native client__

export NACL_SDK_ROOT=/opt/nacl/pepper_23 # Adjust for your environment

You need to first compile "nacl-mounts" from naclports.
cd $NACL_PORTS_ROOT/src
NACL_GLIBC=1 make nacl-mounts
NACL_GLIBC=1 NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=64 make nacl-mounts
