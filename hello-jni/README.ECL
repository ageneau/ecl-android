* You'll need the android SDK + NDK to compile / run this project (assumed to be in /opt/android/android-sdk-linux_86 and /opt/android/android-ndk-r5)
* You'll need to change the path for your cross-compiled ECL in jni/Android.mk (assumed to be in /opt/ecl/android)
* If you want to debug native code on the android emulator, check the procedure in gdb_wrapper.
