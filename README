This project contains the needed patches to run ECL on android.

The included Makefile will download and patch ECL (git is needed).
See INSTALL for details.

You'll need the android SDK + NDK to compile / run this project

The included "HelloEcl" android application demonstrates how to
start/run an in-process ECL from an android app using JNI. It loads
the file "init.lisp" and displays a Toast notification. It also starts
a swank server on port 4005 (on the emulator use "adb forward tcp:4005 
tcp:4005" to be able to connect to it from slime). The first run will
be slow because swank needs to be byte-compiled. To get more 
information on what ECL is doing you might want to enable stdout/stderr
redirection:

adb shell stop
adb shell setprop log.redirect-stdio true
adb shell start

The cross-compiled ecl binary can also be run as a standalone
executable (just "adb push" it to a directory on the emulator and use
"adb shell" to execute it.
