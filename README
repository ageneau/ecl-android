This project contains the needed patches to run ECL on android.

The included Makefile will download and patch ECL (git is needed).
See INSTALL for details.

You'll need the android SDK + NDK to compile / run this project

The included "hello-jni" android application demonstrates how to
start/run ecl from an android app using JNI. Right now it just loads
the file "init.lsp" and displays "Hello World".

The cross-compiled ecl binary can also be run as a standalone
executable (just "adb push" it to a directory on the emulator and use
"adb shell" to execute it.

You'll need to change the path for your cross-compiled ECL in
jni/Android.mk (assumed to be in /opt/ecl/android)
If you want to debug native code on the android emulator, check the
procedure in gdb_wrapper.
