This project is a modified version of Ram Krishnan's eclshell project (https://github.com/kriyative/ecl-iphone-builder/tree/master/eclshell)
You can use the gyp_ios script to recreate the Xcode project.

The Makefile is used to create the libiphone_ios_universal that contains the lisp cocoa bindings. You might want to change the path to the ECL binary for your particular install.
