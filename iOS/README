ECL Build Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run this project you must first follow the instructions in
ecl-android/INSTALL.

If during the installation you used a different path for the

   ECL_INSTALL_ROOT_DIR or 
   GMP_INSTALL_ROOT_DIR 

variables, then you must change the corresponding variables in the
eclshell Xcode project: 

   Open eclshell.xcodeproj with Xcode

   "Projects" -> "Edit Project Settings" -> "Build" tab -> 
   "User Defined" section -> "ECL" and "GMP" variables

eclshell Build Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download and setup a SLIME source directory. The swank-ecl-patches.txt
has been submitted to the SLIME maintainers, and hopefully it will
make it into the CVS builds one of these days, and the patch step will
not be required.

  cd eclshell
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous:anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/slime/cvsroot co -D'2010-01-29' slime
  cd slime
  patch -p0 < ../../swank-ecl-patches.txt
  cd ..

If you specified a different path or SDK version for the ECL build
than the default, be sure to edit the sdk_ver and ecl_root settings in
`eclshell/makefile'.

  make			# see makefile for configuring ecl/gmp path

That should generate a libeclffi.a fat library. 

Now open eclshell.xcodeproj. Run a Simulator or Device
build. Hopefully it will just work, and there will be some noisy
output as SLIME loads, ending eventually with:

;; Swank started at port: 4005.

From a local emacs, run M-x slime-connect, to 127.0.0.1 (if running a
Simulator build, for device builds look at the IP address listed on
the device), port 4005.

Happy hacking.
