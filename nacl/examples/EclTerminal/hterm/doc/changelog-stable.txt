0.8.7, 2012-10-08, Correctness fixes

* Stable release of 0.8.7.5.
* Fix mouse-based text selection when the selection involves styled text.
* Fix hterm.Terminal.insertLines to move the correct rows.  This fixes the
  Reverse Index (RI) sequence (and probably others) that depended on it.
* Backfill holes created by Erase Characters (ECH) and Delete Characters (DCH)
  with spaces in the current text style.
* Fix minor issue with Character Attributes (SGR) with colors 100-107.  These
  were setting the foreground color instead of the background.
* Fix keyboard regression that prevented multi-accelerator sequences
  (ctrl-alt-foo, etc) from working.
* Stop bolding colors >= 16.
* Changed hterm_keyboard.js to only add modifier munging to strings that
  came from the "default" action.  Other actions are assumed to already
  be appropriate for the in use modifier.
* Make Alt-F1...F12 send F11-F22.  This similar to xterm with the "VT220
  Keyboard" option is enabled, except xterm uses Ctrl as the modifier.  We use
  Alt because Ctrl-F1...F12 are not capturable on Chrome OS devices.
* Added a "textInput" event handler to hterm_keyboard.js.  We're not actually
  supposed to get these, but we do on the Mac in the case where a third party
  app sends synthetic keystrokes to Chrome.

Internal bugs:
6111077 Bluetooth OTP not working with hterm
6838548 Bluetooth OTP is not able to make past SSHinaTab

BUG=chromium-os:30857, Shift+F6 doesn't work
BUG=chromium-os:32608, Add extended function key (F13-24) support.
BUG=chromium-os:30258, Text attributes not rendered for whitespace at the end
    of a line

0.8.6, 2012-09-13, Increase max-string-sequence, add enable-clipboard-notice

* Stable release of 0.8.6.0.
* Increased the size of the max-string-sequence pref from 1,024 to 100,000, in
  order to support larger clipboard transfers via OSC 52.
* Add an enable-clipboard-notice preference, defaulted to true.  Change this
  to false to turn off the "Selection Copied" message.
* Added etc/osc52.el, a reference implementation of emacs-to-hterm clipboard
  sync.  The script should also work for xterm and other OSC 52 compliant
  terminals.

0.8.5, 2012-09-07, Selection fixes, etc.

* Stable release of 0.8.5.1.
* The code that tried to determine which node came first in a single-line
  selection was busted.  It didn't work if the selection involved styled
  text.
* Another selection bug.  Triple clicks result in the selection of exactly one
  full row.  This means that the selection ends at the 0 offset of the following
  x-row.  hterm.Terminal.getSelectionText assumed that an x-row couldn't be
  selected, only elements within the row could be.  You could also get into
  this state if you manually selected exactly to the end of a row.
* Clear location.hash when "(C)hoose another connection" is selected.
* Allow Ctrl-W to close window at the reconnect prompt.
* Show product name and version in the title by default.

0.8.4, 2012-09-05, Fix another OSC 4 regression.

* We were mishandling hex X11 rgb values.  They weren't being translated into
  decimal, and would result in invalid CSS rgba(...) values.

0.8.3, 2012-09-05, Stable release of 0.8.3.0

* Reject attempts to resize or realize a row or column count <= 0.  This fixed
  a bug where new windows opened with ctrl-shift-n would usually hang if
  performed from an active connection.

0.8.2, 2012-08-27, Stable release of 0.8.2.10

This is a list of the more notable changes.  For the full list, consult the
changelog-dev.txt file for releases from 0.8.0.1 through 0.8.2.10.

* FAQ updates.
* Fix another bug that would cause missing bottom row(s).
* Make Ctrl-Shift-N/Meta-Shift-N keyboard combinations open a new window.
* Moved common libraries under the "lib" object.
* Add "hterm_" prefix to the hterm source files.
* Add 'use strict' everywhere, fix some fallout.
* Add mouse support via DECSET modes 1000, 1002, 1003.
* Add mouse button paste.  Preference 'mouse-paste-button' defaults to off
  on typical X11, on everywhere else (including Aura on X11).
* Add ability to automatically copy the mouse selection to the keyboard.
  Preference 'copy-on-select' defaults to on.
* Add partial OSC 52 support to allow the host to write to the system clipboard.
  This is off by default, and can be enabled via the 'enable-clipboard-write'
  preference.
* Add basic line editing for local ssh prompts (password, fingerprint prompt,
  and the "~C" command line).
* NaCl plugin changes to prevent the UI from being overwhelmed by a flood of
  data from the host.
* Many terminal correctness fixes.
* Added new connect dialog which can save previous connections and presents
  a UI to import identities.
* Add focus/unfocused cursor styles.
* Be more robust against unterminated sequences (it's now much less likely that
  we'll hang if you cat /dev/random).

0.7.9, 2012-04-23, rginda@chromium.org

* Stable release of SecureShell-dev-0.7.9.3.
* Show app name and version number at startup.
* Add cursor blink preference.
* Add doc/faq.txt, doc/hack.txt.
* Remove old vt100.js file.
* Allow Ctrl +/-/0 to control browser zoom when the browser zoom isn't already
  set to 100%.  This makes it possible to dismiss the new "zoom warning" using
  keyboard shortcuts.
* Modify nassh plugin to accept a hash of environment variables.
* Add 'environment' preference, set by default to { TERM: 'xterm-256color' }.
* Implement Operating System Command (OSC) 4.  This allows the host to set
  or read the terminal color palette.
* Reset color palette on soft terminal reset.
* Add JSDoc to text_attributes.js.
* Merge COLORS_16 and COLORS_256 objects into a single
  TextAttributes.prototype.defaultColorPalette object.
* Fix bold-implies-bright logic for extended colors.
* Add a stern warning message when the browser zoom is not 100%.
* Change the naming convention for sessionStorage keys (added a dot, as in
  googleRelay.queryString).
* Add logic to re-display the connect-to dialog on reload, only if nassh was not
  started from a bookmark.
* Fetch the HTML5 persistent filesystem at nassh startup.
* Add NaSSH..removeAllKnownHosts() and NaSSH..removeKnownHostByIndex(i).  These
  can be accessed from the JS console as 'term_.command.remove...()'.
* Fix Terminal.isPrimaryScreen() assign-instead-of-test typo.
* Fix G0/G2/G3 character set control "ESC (", etc. to properly handle a
  mid-sequence ESC character.  (Thanks to nethack for turning this up :)

0.7.8, 2012-04-11, rginda@chromium.org

* Stable release of SecureShell-dev-0.7.8.3.
* Fix 'home-keys-scroll' preference.
* Fix google_relay.html CSP issues.
* Replace 'alt-sends-escape' preference with 'alt-sends-what'.  The new pref
  can be set to 'escape', '8-bit', or 'browser-key'.  If set to 'escape' (the
  default), hterm will send ESC (as if alt-sends-escape were true, the previous
  default).  If set to '8-bit', hterm sends the unshifted character + 128 (as
  if alt-sends-escape were false).  If set to 'browser-key', hterm waits for
  the keypress event, and sends whatever character code the browser thinks best.
  On Mac, this will depend on your keyboard locale.  Composed characters
  (requiring multiple keystrokes) aren't yet implemented.  'browser-key'
  shoudn't be used on platforms where Chrome uses Alt sequences for the browser.

BUG=chromium-os:29308

0.7.7, 2012-04-10, rginda@chromium.org

* Stable release of SecureShell-dev-0.7.7.1.  (Unpublished due to google_relay
  CSP issue discovered late in testing.)
* Renamed to "Secure Shell".
* Updated stable manifest to include CSP and new icons.
* Update to the latest nassh binaries.
* Fix Ctrl-\.
* Added keyboard related preferences, 'home-keys-scroll', 'page-keys-scroll',
  'meta-sends-escape', 'backspace-sends-backspace'.
* Added altSendsEscape option to keyboard (and 'alt-sends-escape' pref).  The
  default for alt-is-meta is now false, while alt-sends-escape is true.  This
  lets Alt and Meta be distinct keys when possible (like on a Mac), while making
  Alt work "almost" like meta by default.
* Added a little platform detection logic so we don't burn BOTH Alt-1..9 and
  Meta-1..9 on every platform.
* Fixed broken backspaceSendsBackspace behavior.
* Fix Meta-Space to send ESC \x20 rather than ESC [.
* Fix character sizing issues, which solves the missing underscores in some
  fonts, and should solve partial/completely missing terminal row issues.
* Add background-image pref, defaults to a mostly transparent gradient.
* Change a few one-byte colors to work better with both light and dark
  backgrounds.
* Add 'manifest_version': 2 to manifest file, specify default
  Content Security Policy (CSP) policy.
* Kick off nassh initialization from nassh.js rather than
  nassh.html to make CSP happy.
* Move dialog code from terminal.* into nassh.*, makes CSP happier
  and it's the right thing to do.

0.7.6, 2012-03-16, rginda@chromium.org

* Stable release of hterm-dev-0.7.6.3
* Fix regression in bold detection. http://crosbug.com/28020
* Fix regression in terminal reset. http://crosbug.com/27950
* Refactor and clean up of the relay server code.
* Add backoff logic to relay server code.
* Promote Terminal.showOverlay to Terminal.IO.showOverlay.
* PASS on handling Meta-~, since on Mac Meta is Cmd and Cmd-~ is the 'switch
  between windows of this app' sequence.
* Add preferences.  Preferences are persisted to localStorage.  Active hterm
  instances will respond to preference changes by listening to the 'storage'
  event.
* Preferences can be grouped into "profiles" so that it's possible
  to maintain multiple terminal configurations and easily switch
  between them.
* The preference profile can be selected at load-time by adding
  'profile=NAME' to the url used to load nassh.html or crosh.html.

0.7.4, 2012-02-29, rginda@chromium.org

* Stable release of hterm-dev-0.7.4.4.
* Add ability to detect fonts with mismatched bold/normal sizes, and disable
  bold characters when that happens.
* Switch out "Andale Mono" in favor of "Menlo" in the default font family list,
  since bold characters in Andale Mono are a different width than normal
  weight characters.
* Fix CONNECTING message to take a single DESTINATION parameter rather
  than distinct USER and HOST parameters.  This avoids an issue in the
  chrome i18n code that chokes on the translated messages.
  http://crosbug.com/26620
* Fix issues with ESC 0x20 handler.
* Fix permission issue in package.sh script.
* Remove spash screen.
* Warn before closing an active crosh tab.
